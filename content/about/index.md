Hi, I am Songi ðŸ˜Š

My favorite quote: Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our reponse. In our response lies our growth and our freedom (Viktor E. Frankl). I always keep this in mind to remind me that I am the one who can manage and be responsible for myself. I try my best to be better in every aspect and not to regret what I've done. Though I think of myself as a wandering child nowadays, I hope I would be better.

For academic aspects, I've researched and studied **cloud-native security**, which can be described as container security, during my master's course. Among different phases of the container's lifecycle, I mainly focus on **runtime security** powered by **eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter)**. eBPF is now widely used, so I guess everyone knows about it. Since it provides helpful observability to a system by attaching eBPF programs to the kernel's wide range of hookpoints, it can help a system administrator enforce specific actions when events occur as defined by eBPF programs. I've worked with eBPF by taking advantage of it for cloud-native security, especially runtime security. You can read my work below!

    + ["Container Instrumentation and Enforcement System for Runtime Security of Kubernetes Platform with eBPF (Intelligent Automation & Soft Computing)"][journal3link]
      + This work is the extended version of the paper I wrote for the conference below. The paper basically uses **BPF-LSM** (a LSM implementation powered by eBPF) to enforce specific policies to a or a group of container. The policy will be provided in a YAML format, helping the admin make eBPF programs easily.

    + ["MDagg: A New Aggregation Method Using Mahalanobis Distance"][lecturenote1link]
      + In this work, the target is a federated learning architecture. I suggest a new aggregation rule to avoid malicious gradients when aggregating by considering relations among gradients with **Mahalanobis distance, not just Euclidian distance**. But unfortunately, there is no specific equation since my math is terrible ðŸ¥². I enjoy mathematical thinking, but it is hard to calculate exact answers than understand them intuitively. So I thought the idea was not that bad... but who knows ðŸ¤£

    + ["Implementation of Opensource-Based Automatic Monitoring Service Deployment and Image Integrity Checkers for Cloud-Native Environment (Journal of the Korea Institute of Information Security & Cryptology)"][journal2link]
      + In this work, I implement docker-compose environment to setup open-source container monitoring tool - which is **Falco**. I integrate monitoring system and some other tools to visualize matrix - which are **Prometheus and Grafana**. It's not an advanced work, I devloped how we deploy monitoring tools with docker more easily. ++ Image integrity check with **DCT (Docker Content Trust)**

  - **Conference Papers**
    + **_2022 Best Student Paper from KISTI_**, MobiSec Conference for my paper "KRSIE: An eBPF-based Kubernetes Runtime Security Instrumentation and Enforcement System"
- Basically, I work with **Docker and Kubernetes** environment on **Linux Ubuntu OS**. Thus, I have some basic knowledge for these systems. To make applications, I program with these languages: **C, python, and Golang**. Especially, I've tried to learn **eBPF technology**!


#### Bachelor Degree, Changwon National University, Changwon, 51140, Republic of Korea
<small>2017 - 2021.02</small>

- Graduate Computer Engineering Department.
- Since my major was computer engineering, I've learned a plethora of things encompassing all sorts of the computer knowledge overall. 
- I belonged to **"Computer Network Laboratory"**. In the lab, I've learn basic network knowledge including wireless network. I also joined a work with my lab members, the work is ["Time-Sensitive Networking Technologies for Industrial Automation in Wireless Communication Systems (Energies, 2021)"][journal1link].

- I could say I've done two main projects during my undergraduate days.
  + **_Group matching application for study within university (Android Application)_**
    + In this project, I coded things related to server side stuff. I setup **Window server and Maria DB** built on the top of **AWS EC2 instance and RDS (Relational Database Service)**. I chose **PHP** as server side script language after testing some other things (PHP, JSP, and ASP). Moreover, I experienced implementing email verification service since the application only allows university students to use the app :) ++ **Java skills**
  + **_Trading used goods application based on block-chain technology (Android Application)_**
    + In this project, I also coded server side stuff. For this app, I setup **Ubuntu server with AWS EC2 instance** and I used **Node.js** server. For this project, I implemented SMS (Message service in Korea) verification service. Also, I setup local Ethereum network to deploy smart contract which will prove transaction of used goods in the future. 
- I got A+ on the subjects "Information Security" and "System Security", it is not a big task, but I'd had interests on security area through the classes at the very beginning.
